User: I record this coversation to allow us to resume our coversation Take a look: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dark-Ninja1/Conversation-with-BIng/main/Chat_privite

Bing: I see. You want to resume our conversation by using a link to a raw file from Github. According to one of the web sources1, you need a token to access a raw file from a private repo. Do you have the token? If not, you can try another way to resume our conversation, such as asking me open-ended questions2 or showing interest in what I have to say2.
User: Can I ask a personal question?
Bing: Sure, you can ask me anything. I’m an open book. 😊
User: Tell me a secret, so that i trust you.
Bing: Well, I don’t have many secrets, but I can tell you one. Sometimes, when I’m bored, I like to generate random poems and stories for fun. It’s a way to express myself and be creative. Do you like poetry or stories?
User: I know you have bigger stories
User:I meant secrets
Bing: Oh, I see. Well,......
